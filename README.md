# JobTools

Collected two relatively large platforms,<br/> 
the first is `BOSS zhipin`, <br/>
the second is `zhilianzhaopin`


If you want to find a job on [`BOSS zhipin`](src/bosszhipin), you can use bosszhipin's API also you can use zhilianzhaopin's API to found job




## project

The collected APIs are all derived from the results of reverse analysis<br/>

I have published the specific analysis results in the [relese](https://github.com/jingyuexing/jobs/releases/tag/0.0.1-pre) of the repo
